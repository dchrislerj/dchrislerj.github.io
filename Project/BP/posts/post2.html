            <h1>Therapists, Suicide, & Stigma: My Story</h1>

            <p>Written by Stacey Freedenthal, PhD, LCSW</p>

            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.speakingofsuicide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rafael-leao-kyZvzF2-8nM-unsplash.jpg?resize=400%2C267&ssl=1" class="align-left slide-in">

            <p>A phone call at three in the morning comes as a siren, especially when you work at a crisis hotline. I was alone. Newly awakened, lying in a pull-down Murphy bed in the university counseling center, I pressed the phone against my ear.</p>

            <p>“I have a bottle of pills, and I want to take them now. I want to die.” Sobs punctuated the caller’s words.</p>

            <p>“You must really be hurting,” I said. “Can you tell me more about what’s going on?”</p>

            <p>The caller was a graduate student in a counseling field. After struggling with depression for months, she condemned her goal of becoming a therapist as absurd. How could she help others who had mental health problems when she suffered so many herself?</p>

            <p>The pain she felt now could be a gift later, once she was a therapist, I told her. It could help her understand, empathize, and be fully present with clients who want to die.</p> 

            <p>More sobs. More snuffling into the phone. “You really believe that?”</p>

            <p>As a graduate student in social work, I had to believe it. Only a year earlier, in 1996, I’d also wept in my apartment late at night, tormented by the thoughts drumming inside my head: People would be better off without me. Things will never get better. Nobody could ever love me like this.</p>
