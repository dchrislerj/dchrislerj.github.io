            <h1>Speak of Suicide with Thousands of Readers</h1>

            <h2>Personal Stories</h2>

            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.speakingofsuicide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/erik-mclean-aNZnKZKfAq8-unsplash.jpg?resize=450%2C300&ssl=1" class="align-center slide-in">

            <p>Your personal stories could address experiences with:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Coping with suicidal thoughts</li>
                <li>Surviving a suicide attempt</li>
                <li>Losing a loved one to suicide</li>
                <li>Being in a relationship (romantic, parenting, or otherwise) with someone with suicidal thoughts</li>
                <li>Working as a therapist, hotline counselor, or other helper for people with suicidal thoughts</li>
                <li>Other stories you’ve lived that it could help others – and you – to share. (In keeping with the site’s focus, your story should be related to suicide or suicidality in some way.)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Opinion Pieces</h2>

            <p>If you want to write an essay about your views related to suicide and its prevention, possible topics could include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ways to help other people not only stay alive, but want to stay alive</li>
                <li>The pros and cons of suicide prevention efforts today (including involuntary hospitalization, therapists’ duty to protect, and more)</li>
                <li>The power of pets to help prevent suicide. Especially cats. (Just sayin’.)</li>
                <li>OK, dogs, too.</li>
                <li>Really, just about anything goes, as long as you abide by the Comments Policy. Which reminds me…</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Speak of Suicide…within Limits</h2>

            <p>As I explained in a previous post, there are limits to what I’ll publish on this site. Before you submit something, whether a possible guest post or comment after others’ posts, please review the Comments Policy. You’ll also want to look at the site’s policy on guest articles.</p>

            <p>In particular, note that I won’t publish a post that contains or serves as advertising, directly or indirectly, for a commercial venture or company. It probably won’t surprise you to know that I also will turn down anything that encourages or gives instructions on suicide.</p>

            <p>Oh, please just read the Comments Policy. There’s lots more I won’t publish, too.</p>

            <h2>Why Publish on Speaking of Suicide’s site?</h2>

            <p>Right now the site gets about 25,000-30,000 views a month. (Google changed its algorithm a while back, which seems to have affected traffic; there was a time when 100,000 people a month visited.)</p>

            <p>If your guest post is published, I’ll share it on my Twitter and Facebook accounts. I’ll share its Google Analytics data with you, so you can see how many people it’s reaching. You’re welcome, too, to respond to comments that people leave.</p>

            <h2>The Site’s First Guest Post, by Shannon Parkin</h2>

            <p>The site’s first guest post is Finding Hope After 30 Years of Depression and a Suicide Attempt, by Shannon Parkin. Even though I’ve read Shannon’s account several times already, I still shiver a little when I think about all she’s gone through, all she’s learned, and all she wants to share with others. I think her story will move you, too.</p>

            <h2>One More Thing</h2>

            <p>This new experiment with guest posts marks a convergence of my past and present selves. Many years ago, I was a journalist. While in college, I worked in various editing positions at The Daily Texan, the student newspaper for the University of Texas.</p>

            <p>I always enjoyed editing, and I’m happy to get that hat out of my basement, dust it off, and put it on again. Even if it does make my hair kinda look funny whenever I wear a hat.</p>

            <p>So, if you’re interested, send a query or a piece of your writing to me at speakingofsuicide@gmail.com, and we’ll take it from there. Thanks, all.</p>
