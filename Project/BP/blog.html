                            On August 30, 2021, Jonathan Singer, PhD, LCSW, announced his resignation from the presidency of the American Association of Suicidology. At his request, I posted his resignation letter here in order to make the letter accessible to as many people as possible. On Sept. 14, he asked me to remove the letter, and I did. […]

                            A phone call at three in the morning comes as a siren, especially when you work at a crisis hotline. I was alone.

                            In May of 2015, I jumped in front of a Metro train in Silver Spring, Maryland. I wanted to die. Somehow, I survived. I don’t remember my suicide attempt or the initial six weeks of my recovery.  My first memory is when my daughter, Greta, visited me in the hospital. Just two days earlier, Greta […]
